							<h2>testimonials</h2>
							<blockquote>Robert Simpson and Valerie Fox</blockquote>
							<h4>
            <div class="spaced">After purchasing our duplex in 2000 we initially approached the city about doing a condominium conversion. They gave us a list of requirements including bringing the building up to code. We dutifully fulfilled the requirements but were not approved due to an item that was never mentioned and not on the list of requirements. <br /><br />

			Linda, our land surveyor, helped us develop another strategy which involved a lot of research on her part and testimony to the planning commission and the city council. With her help we successfully appealed the planning commission’s decision to the city council and our project was approved.<br /><br />

			Without Linda’s help, hard work and encouragement, we would have given up. We can highly recommend her. She goes way beyond what we would expect of a land surveyor.
