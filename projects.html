						<td>This comprehensive project included the resolution of complex title issues based on unwritten rights along with boundary disputes and encroachments. An enormous amount of historical research was conducted on Corinthian Island to determine the discrepancy between the deed location of the property boundary and right of ways versus the physical location of improvements. <br /><br />

						Upon completion of the historical research, Linda conducted negotiations between adjoining property owners through her non-traditional mediation who then entered into an acceptable boundary agreement. Once the boundary agreement was complete, she negotiated with the city to abandon unused paper lanes and then prepared the necessary documents to be recorded.  <br />&nbsp;

						While the entire restoration project area lay within the National Park Service’s GGNRA, the San Francisco Zen Center also owned sections of the land to be used in this project. The project included hundreds of acres that were the farming and grazing land of the historic Sausalito Ranch, which was subdivided by the Tamalpais Land and Water Company in the late 1800s. With little current boundary evidence available, we resolved the location of the property lines by interviewing land owners, interpreting historic field notes, identifying original fence lines, and traversing 3500 feet of line. In addition to the actual surveying work conducted, Linda Carruthers was a member of the team that negotiated a successful outcome for all the landowners involved in the project.

						The historic Crystal Springs tunnel allows water to flow from the upper Crystal Springs reservoir through an inlet tower and out an outlet portal in the lower reservoir. The flow of water could be turned off by a gate valve which is located in the bottom of a vertical shaft under highway 92, in case of flooding or an earthquake. <br /><br />

						The outlet portal was previously identified by a dive team, but the City of San Francisco and a private dive company were unable to locate to the gate valve and the inlet portal that had not been serviced in over half a century. Through the interpretation of historic maps from 1924 that were developed to repair a break in the tunnel from the 1906 earthquake, Linda Carruthers used highly technical surveying equipment along with practical experience to identify the true location of the gate shaft manhole in Highway 92.  She then personally led the dive team to the precise location of the inlet tower that was submerged approximately 30 feet under water.<br />&nbsp;<br /></td>

						The Marin Municipal Water District contracted to lay a new 42" HDPE drinking water supply pipeline along the historic riverbed in Bon Tempe Lake. Linda Carruthers assisted the contractor in positioning the pipeline on the water in the location called for by the plans. <br /><br />

						In the beginning of this project, Linda reviewed the plans and identified several problems. MMWD had provided the hydrographic survey that was used for bidding the project, but it was not accurate. Only during submergence did the contractor first learn that the design alignment was inaccurate by 10’ or more along the initial corridor section. Linda conducted a land survey and dive inspection to prepare and develop as-built drawings and profiles to show the location of the newly submerged pipeline in relationship to the design alignment.<br /><br />

						In addition to surveying and mapping for this project, Linda also provided expert testimony for the contractor, clarifying the discrepancy between the hydrographic survey and the actual location of the pipeline.
